                <h3>Old Bay Seasoned <span class="biggs">BIGGS</span></h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="biggs">BIGGS</span> Old Bay Seasoned sunflower seeds are my personal favorite flavor.   The first package was mediocre, as was the second.  When I eventually
                    decided to give them another try though, something clicked. The flavor of Old Bay Seasoning is so closeley associated with seafood in my mind these remind me of having an amazing
                    seafood boil without actually tasting like seafood.   I am forced to order these from Amazon as they are hard to find in person.

                <p>
                    <span class="biggs">BIGGS</span> Takis Fuego sunflower seeds are a close runner up  to the Old Bay Seasoned.  These are alot easier to find ase of late due to the massive
                    popularity of Takis tortilla chips.  These are very good, the flavor is exactly the same as the chips as is the include heartburn.

                <h3>Taco Supreme <span class="biggs">BIGGS</span></h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="biggs">BIGGS</span> Taco Supreme sunflower are the most embarrassing flavor in the lineup, but they are good. These actually have a Taco Bell type 
                    of taste to them.  Its strange to have the flavor of a Tex-mex taco in a seed but it works.<br><br>
                    Similarly to the Old Bay Seasoned seeds, I did not care for these at first.  However, they have replaced Dill Pickle 
                    <span class="biggs">BIGGS</span> in the top three line up....for now.
